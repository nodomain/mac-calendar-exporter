# Project Progress

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Project setup and structure
- ✅ EventKit calendar access implementation
- ✅ ICS file generation with proper timezone support (Europe/Berlin)
- ✅ SFTP upload functionality
- ✅ Configuration management via .env file
- ✅ CLI interface for manual execution
- ✅ Privacy-focused export (titles and times only by default)
- ✅ Timezone fix for Home Assistant integration
- ✅ Automated scheduling via launchd
- ✅ Setup script with interactive and non-interactive modes
- ✅ Documentation and README
- ✅ Code cleanup (removed unused calendar implementations)
- ✅ Title length limiting to prevent line breaks in Home Assistant dashboards

## Future Enhancements
- Calendar event filtering options
- Advanced error handling and recovery
- Log file support for better troubleshooting
- Multi-calendar exports to separate files
- Support for additional timezone configurations
- Web interface for status monitoring

## Known Issues
- SFTP connections show deprecation warnings for TripleDES (library issue, doesn't affect functionality)
- Key-based authentication requires non-encrypted private key files

## Current Status
The project is fully functional and deployed. It successfully exports calendar events from the macOS Calendar app to an ICS file with proper timezone support, and uploads the file to an SFTP server automatically via launchd scheduling. The exporter is specifically configured for privacy by default, including only event titles and times but not descriptions or locations.
